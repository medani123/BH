                  day-to-day work and ensuring our long-term growth. Both
                  integrity and sustainability are closely linked to our four

                  Management follows three steps: Definition of sustainability
                  risks and categories, Identification of the relevant
                  suppliers, Development and implementation of necessary
                  procurement processes to cover these risks. Risk categories
                  can include particular suppliers: Based in higher-risk
                  countries, Providing products subject to “Responsible Minerals
                  Sourcing (RMS)”, Relevant for CO2 reduction engagement.

                  transfer of knowledge about sustainability. We support our
                  suppliers through our “Sustainability in the Supply Chain” and
                  “Code of Conduct” brochures, and we explicitly encourage them
                  to extend these values and sustainability requirements further
                  into their own supply chain in order to create a network of
                  interactions and business relations that are built on trust.
