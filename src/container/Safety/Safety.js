                performance in achieving NOO HSE expectations and will provide

                Contractor HSE systems and performance will be evaluated during
                the tendering process prior to contract award and their project
                specific HSE plans will be subject to review and approval by
                NOO. Effective implementation of the HSE Plans and performance
                against defined HSE targets will be monitored during the
                execution of the project.
